# Zimension

Welcome to Zimension, a todo kind of app which is used to keep track of projects and its operations. It is a sleek and modern web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project offers a minimal yet robust setup to get you started with React in a Vite environment, complete with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and essential ESLint rules.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with Zimension, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toakshh/zimension.git
   cd zimension
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the local server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

4. **Build for Production**
   To build the app for production, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command will generate a `dist` folder with all the optimized production files.

## Features

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Enjoy an enhanced development experience with instant feedback.
- **ESLint Integration**: Maintain code quality with predefined ESLint rules tailored for React and TypeScript.

## Expanding ESLint Configuration

For production applications, consider updating the ESLint configuration to enable type-aware lint rules. This includes configuring the top-level `parserOptions` property and adding additional plugins and rules as needed.
